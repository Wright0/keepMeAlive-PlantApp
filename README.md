# Keep Me Alive - Plant app

## Project overview

https://keep-me-alive-plant.herokuapp.com/

Team project | React.js - Spring - PostgreSQL | 7 day project

An app that teaches users how to take care of different plants, and then test their knowledge in an interactive quiz-style game where they try to keep that plant alive.

This single-page app uses React Router to provide a multi-page feel and experience. This allows a user to send information pages and games to their friends for specific plants.

Some fun in game features:
- The plant dynamically changes (grows or dies) depending on the player's progress
- The user has 30 seconds to answer the questions. Every 15 seconds, they lose a point
- A health bar shows the plant's overall health
