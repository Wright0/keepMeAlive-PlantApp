export default GameResult;


    //I will show the results.
    // 2 buttons: Go home, play again.
    // Go home: goes back to main selector
    // Play again goes back to the PlantInfo

    //Whichever they select, state gets reset in the GameContainer?
    //After this component is destroyed?
    //Can the props persist if the state is cleared? To discover.
